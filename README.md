# MyReads Project

## Requisites
- [Node.js and NPM](nodejs.org) >= v8.2.1

## Instructions

1. clone repo
`git clone https://github.com/zayrus/mybooks `

2. 'move to project folder'
`cd mybooks`

3. Install Modules
`npm install`

4. Start
`npm start`

## Use
In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

The main page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.
When a book is on a bookshelf, it should have the same state on both the main application page and the search page.
The search page also has a link to / (the root URL), which leads back to the main page.
When you navigate back to the main page from the search page, you should instantly see all of the selections you made on the search page in your library.
